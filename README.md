# Basketball Simulation Manager
 This is an attempt to create a basketball simulation somewhat similar to 2k, but much much much simplified.
 I did not want to buy the new 2k game, so I thought I might as well see if I can recreate it.
 This is the old Python code. It works for the most part, but I couldn't properly get it to switch between 1v1 and team games.

 I'm stopping the work on the python side and I am trying to stat again in Java to touch up on my Java skills and to further dive into OOP.
 Will add the java version once I have a working version.
